### Query Parameters
- `status` - Filter by task status (upcoming, completed, missed)
- `urgency` - Filter by urgency level (high, medium, low)

## Time-Aware Features

### Automatic Status Updates
Tasks automatically transition between three states:
- **Upcoming**: Default state for tasks with future deadlines
- **Completed**: Set when user manually marks task as complete
- **Missed**: Automatically set when deadline passes without completion

### Urgency Classification
Tasks are automatically classified based on time until deadline:
- **High**: 1 day or less until deadline
- **Medium**: 2-3 days until deadline
- **Low**: More than 3 days until deadline

### Auto-Bucketing
The system automatically categorizes tasks into buckets for easy management:
- Updates happen in real-time when accessing the API
- Management command available for batch updates
- Frontend automatically refreshes to show current state

## Management Commands

Update all task statuses based on current time:
```bash
python manage.py update_task_status --verbose
```

## SOLID Principles Implementation

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class has a single, well-defined responsibility
2. **Open/Closed Principle**: Code is open for extension but closed for modification
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Derived classes are substitutable for base classes
4. **Interface Segregation Principle**: Interfaces are focused and specific
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Django 5.2.4, Django REST Framework
- **Database**: SQLite (development), easily configurable for PostgreSQL/MySQL
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- **Styling**: Modern CSS Grid/Flexbox with responsive design
- **Time Handling**: Django's timezone-aware datetime handling
